## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Salesforce - Marketing Cloud Einstein
**Lead Machine Learning Engineer**  
_Feb 2022 - Current_

- Contributed to the Trust Layer on Salesforce AI platforms of Salesforce CoPilot. Trust Layer ensures LLM compliance with Salesforce AI ethics standards. Implemented trust vector detection, including PII identification, prompt defense, and toxicity analysis. Evaluated both internal and external LLMs and models against diverse trust metrics.
- Led the development of retrieval augmentation for Salesforce Flow GPT, which enables the automatic generation of marketing workflows and code. Enhanced prompt grounding by improving semantic relevance between prompts and meta objects. Managed the project from proof of concept to general availability. Collaborated with research, platform, and product teams to define the architecture and integrate the implementation.
- Responsible for python model service to marketing cloud which powers next generation ML powered use cases such as subject line generation and model bot. Improved and guided python best practices.

### EBAY - NLP Core Technology
**Member of Technical Staff II**  
_May 2020 - Feb 2022_

- Improved trust in the commerce ecosystem by building machine learning models to identify bad actors and remove offensive materials.
- Contributed to end-to-end NLP framework which takes NLP models from exploration to deployments. Features include CLI to load all NLP models, helm chart deployments to Kubernetes clusters, batch model inference in HDFS, and load testing framework.
- Trained Ebert-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) Pytorch models and deployed to production for online inferencing. Federated Kubernetes deployment achieves 4500 TPS. Tuned model and services.

### EBAY - Core Search
**Technical Lead (Search and Ads)**  
_Nov 2018 - May 2020_

- Enhanced ranking algorithm to maximize revenue between Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Sale (CPS). To support the new CPC program, led a team of data scientists and engineers to build a pClick and revenue floor model.
- Built machine learning models to suggest item ad rate guidance for eBay sellers on the Promoted Listings program.
- As part of an initiative to change the search experience, explored search modules to help customers understand the inventory and make value tradeoffs.
- Improved search ranking algorithm with user segmentation features, which includes hand-crafted features and embedding representations.
- Designed and architected Spark Data Pipeline used for all search monetization data requirements. Pipeline was scaled to 40+ jobs, adopted by multiple projects, and contributed by data engineers, data scientists, and software engineers.

### EBAY - Haito
**Member Of Technical Staff I/II (Search and Chatbots)**  
_Jan 2016 - Nov 2018_

- **Recommendation**: Worked on recommendation modules for the item and home page for the eBay HaiTao website. Item-based recommendation modules utilize a deep learning model to recommend items based on item similarities. Home page recommendation module leverages user view history to make personal recommendations via a collaborative filtering model. Final pipeline includes Airflow orchestration of ETL, ML training, and deployment.
- **Recommendation**: Worked on commerce Knowledge Graph for aspect recommendation and similar queries. Enriched knowledge graph with general knowledge from Wikidata. Created Spark ETL to ingest 450G of dense data, web service to handle client queries. Implemented ontology mapping between Wikidata and relevant nodes on the eBay Knowledge Graph by leveraging Wordnet.
- **Search ranking and relevance**: Core member in designing and implementing a search engine leveraging structure search and various machine learning models. Components included recall, relevance, and machine-learned ranking.
- **Search pipeline**: Wrote the near real-time data pipeline for search listing index, which achieves a sustained 8,000 Elasticsearch updates/sec and is replicated across multiple international regions. Search index supports the entire 1 billion eBay items. To ensure data integrity, drove an integration regression framework and various spark jobs used to validate data integrity of the data pipeline.
- Championed best practices so new team members can onboard efficiently and effectively.

### SERVICENOW
**Senior Software Engineer**  
_2012 – 2015_

- Developed cloud infrastructure management software to enable customers to provision, discover, and apply change control to resources on Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services cloud.
- Mentored junior developers and helped new team members come up to speed.

### LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LAB
**Computer Scientist**  
_2011 – 2012_

- Wrote simulation jobs for the National Ignition Facility, which is the world’s largest laser facility dedicated to achieving fusion. Distributed jobs run on the lab’s High Performance Computing Platform using Message Passing Interface (MPI), OpenMP, and MOAB (a job scheduler).

### APPLE
**Software Engineer**  
_2009 – 2011_

- Designed WiFi calibration models to optimize transmit power over operations modes and frequencies. Algorithm uses machine learning (regression analysis) to select calibration parameters to meet antenna power transmission requirements.
- Explored using models to predict iPhone hardware failures. Built a toolset to collect, analyze, and train models.
