### Background
Becoming an expert in machine learning (or any field) requires moving beyond memorizing facts to truly mastering the material. Inspired by Bloom's Revised Taxonomy, I recently explored how these six levels of thinking can deepen my understanding and improve how I communicate my expertise with coworkers, professional conversations, and personal projects. Let’s look at each level and how it can sharpen skills in machine learning.

### Level 1: Memorization
At the base level, memorization relies on repeating information until it sticks, using tools like flashcards or re-reading material. While basic facts—like syntax, functions, and key terms—help form a foundation, they’re not enough for real-world problem-solving. Today, with easy access to information through resources like ChatGPT, memorization holds less value than it once did, especially in machine learning where application and deeper understanding matter most.

### Level 2: Comprehension
With comprehension, we start to understand information, going beyond facts to grasp what they mean. In machine learning, comprehension shows up when we can explain essential concepts—like overfitting, underfitting, or gradient descent—in simple terms. Testing comprehension by explaining ideas to someone else, even a child, reinforces our understanding. This level aligns with how we typically learn in college, where we’re encouraged to make sense of complex concepts rather than just remember them.

### Level 3: Application
Application involves using what we know to solve problems. In machine learning, this ranges from solving basic coding problems to tackling complex projects. Applying knowledge might mean implementing a linear regression model, experimenting with different data-cleaning techniques, or practicing coding challenges that require a mix of data structures and algorithms. Each problem we tackle builds a bridge between our theoretical knowledge and real-world skills.

### Level 4: Analysis
Analysis requires us to compare, contrast, and identify relationships. In machine learning, this might look like evaluating different algorithms, model architectures, or data-preprocessing methods. Tools like Venn diagrams, summaries, and comparison tables help visualize these relationships and deepen our understanding. Requesting level-4 questions from ChatGPT or similar tools can also help develop analytical skills, pushing us to think critically about each element and its role.

### Level 5: Evaluation
Evaluation asks us to think critically and prioritize. We start asking questions like “Why does this approach work best?” or “How can we improve it?” By prioritizing, we build decision-making skills, which become essential for real-world applications. For example, in machine learning, we might evaluate and justify a choice between model interpretability and accuracy, deciding which holds more value for the specific problem. Creating mind maps and questioning assumptions can help us refine these evaluative skills.

### Level 6: Creation
The highest level, creation, means generating something new—whether it’s a hypothesis, a novel solution, or an innovative model. In machine learning, this could involve designing new algorithms, hypothesizing methods to handle unusual data, or even identifying gaps in existing solutions. At this stage, we become active contributors, moving from consumers of knowledge to creators and innovators.

By building skills at each level, we move closer to true mastery. Each stage brings new insights and strengthens our abilities to solve problems, make decisions, and create impactful work in machine learning.
