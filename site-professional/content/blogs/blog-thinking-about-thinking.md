# Background
ML knowledge and capabilities have grown exponentially, marked by an unprecedented rate of increase in model sophistication, research output, compute resources, and real-world applications. ML related research papers have increased at an annual rate of 35% since 2012.  Model parameters, as a first order estimate for model complexities and capabilities, has grown roughly 10 times every 1-2 years.  Models like GPT-4 and Claude has achieved near human scores on challenging tasks, such as standardized exams and domain specific benchmarks like GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) and MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding).
The rate of growth will likely grow as the data model application flywheel is further optimized and companies continue to invest tremendous resources in AI initiatives.

In today’s fast-changing knowledge landscape, I aim to add maximum my value by identifying the areas where human insight best complements LLM capabilities. By internalizing this approach, I hope to build deep expertise in any subject efficiently and effectively.

## Knowledge Taxonomy
### Level 1: Memorization
At the base level, memorization relies on repeating information until it sticks, using tools like flashcards or re-reading material. While basic facts—like syntax, functions, and key terms—help form a foundation, they’re not enough for real-world problem-solving. Today, with easy access to information through resources like ChatGPT, memorization holds less value than it once did, especially in machine learning where application and deeper understanding matter most.

I believe this type of knowledge is essential for building a foundation in any domain, but its value has gradually declined as search engines and LLMs now make information easily accessible.

### Level 2: Comprehension
With comprehension, we start to understand information, going beyond facts to grasp what they mean. In machine learning, comprehension shows up when we can explain essential concepts—like overfitting, underfitting, or gradient descent—in simple terms. Testing comprehension by explaining ideas to someone else, even a child, reinforces our understanding. This level aligns with how we typically learn in college, where we’re encouraged to make sense of complex concepts rather than just remember them. 

True understanding, to me, means being able to break down complex ideas into simpler components that anyone, even non-ML practitioners, can grasp. When tackling complex problems, it’s essential to comprehend the big picture while also identifying the key details and concerns to optimize.

### Level 3: Application
Application involves using what we know to solve problems. In machine learning, this ranges from solving basic coding problems to tackling complex projects. Applying knowledge might mean implementing a linear regression model, experimenting with different data-cleaning techniques, or practicing coding challenges that require a mix of data structures and algorithms. Each problem we tackle builds a bridge between our theoretical knowledge and real-world skills.  

Simple applications tend to require one ML concept or domain.  Solving complex ML problems often, in my experience, requires one to draw on multiple ML domains: data, cloud native applications, modeling, infrastructure, and user understanding. An example of this is the LLM. LLM combines several key ML technologies: transformer architecture for natural language abilities, reinforcement learning for alignment, supervised/unsupervised learning for instruction tuning, and large scale distributed training and inferencing optimizations.  LLM integration into a product requires often requires prompt engineering grounded with objects hydrated and scored offline.

### Level 4: Analysis
Analysis requires us to compare, contrast, and identify relationships. In machine learning, this might look like evaluating different algorithms, model architectures, or data-preprocessing methods. Tools like Venn diagrams, summaries, and comparison tables help visualize these relationships and deepen our understanding. We have to think critically about each component and its role within a set of constraints. Which algorithm families should we explore for this domain problem?  What component should we do offline or online dependencies?

### Level 5: Evaluation
Evaluation asks us to think critically and prioritize. We start asking questions like “Why does this approach work best?” or “How can we improve it?” By prioritizing, we build decision-making skills, which become essential for real-world applications. For example, in machine learning, we might evaluate and justify a choice between model interpretability and accuracy, deciding which holds more value for the specific problem. Creating mind maps and questioning assumptions can help us refine these evaluative skills.

In my experience across various ML projects, effective prioritization often aligns with the project stage. For greenfield projects, it's crucial to focus on rapid prototyping, gathering stakeholder/user feedbacks, validating hypotheses, and extracting insights quickly. For mature projects, priorities shift to defining optimization metrics that closely reflect business goals and building ML code infrastructure that maximize scalability, reliability, maintainability, and high iteration speed.

### Level 6: Creation
The highest level, creation, means generating something new—whether it’s a hypothesis, a novel solution, or an innovative model. In machine learning, this could involve designing new algorithms, hypothesizing methods to handle unusual data, or even identifying gaps in existing solutions. At this stage, we become active contributors, moving from consumers of knowledge to creators and innovators.


# Conclusion
The knowledge taxonomy gives a good way to estimate the value of a set of knowledge. It provides a north star to focus on creating and learning on level 3 and above knowledge. By building intentions and skills at each level, we move closer to deeper mastery. Each stage brings new insights and strengthens our abilities to solve problems, make decisions, and create impactful work in machine learning.
